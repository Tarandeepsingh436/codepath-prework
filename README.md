 2 - What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? 
 How did you overcome it?
 
  In creating this submission i have to work from scratch as i did it 
 in few years back. I started from the challenge where i need to make
 a button to adding a sound to the button. it took me a lot of time 
 as i was searching a lot of website how people have done this and 
 checking there resoursces.
 
 
 
 3 - What questions about web development do you have after completing 
 your submission?
 

 It was fun doing this project.I am excited to know what other levels are there in 
 web developing.I have heared about different kind of things like node.js, angular.js,
 react.js, UI and UX. I have just heared of them and i know thery are used in making them 
 but never used it . 
 
 
 
 
 4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you 
 spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, 
 adding additional features, etc). Be specific. 
 (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 
 
 1. Firstly,i would like to change the sound and different animal sound instead of 
 that which will be more inresting to play.
 
 2.I would also like to add things like the picture of the animal when the button 
 is clicked for the specific sound.
 
 3. I would have add a option of making your own account option and also have different
 kinds of option of sounds and different lessons like flying animals,vechiles and  for the kids which they can learn one by 
 one and unlcok the next once they cleared the last challenege.
 
 4 I would have made my code more clear and more in   way step by step.
 
 5 i would have also add the setting button in which you have the option of changing into light mode,dark mode, system default.
