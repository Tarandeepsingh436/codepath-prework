2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
In creating this submission i have to work from scratch as i did it in few years back. I started from the challenge where i need to make  a button to adding a sound to the button. it took me a lot of time as i was searching a lot of website how people have done this and checking there resoursces.I did experment alot but was not succsful for a lot of things i was thinking to add as i said it in the 4 question. I faced challenge in learning the functions and have to go through the learning process of it as i am not good at it. But this time i really push myself and implement the things. I learned a lot by the way but i choose the strategy of learning javascript the same way i learn java. I think of the code as the same way as i learned the java and c++ functions and did it the implementation. I compare the code and see how they are similar and different which reallyl speed up the process and the rest was the implmentation.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

 It was fun doing this project.I am excited to know what other levels are there in web developing.I have heared about different kind of things like node.js, angular.js,react.js, UI and UX. I have just heared of them and i know thery are used in making them but never used it . 
 
 I was curious to get to know what additional things i can do. i ahevnt learnt js well but once i did i will leanr other things that i am wishing to implement like node.js, angualr.js, etc i wonder how i cna implement them and make it more intresting?. I hopefully start learning the  node js and angular from linkdin learning.
 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

 
 1. Firstly,i would like to change the sound and different animal sound instead of 
 that which will be more inresting to play.
 
 2.I would also like to add things like the picture of the animal when the button 
 is clicked for the specific sound.
 
 3. I would have add a option of making your own account option and also have different
 kinds of option of sounds and different lessons like flying animals,vechiles and  for the kids which they can learn one by 
 one and unlcok the next once they cleared the last challenege.
 
 4 I would have made my code more clear and more in   way step by step.
 
 5 I would have also add the setting button in which you have the option of changing into light mode,dark mode, system default.
